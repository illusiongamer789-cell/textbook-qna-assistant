AI Textbook Q&A AssistantThis is a full-stack web application that allows students and teachers to have interactive conversations with their PDF textbooks. Using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model powered by the Google Gemini API, this tool provides answers based exclusively on the content of the uploaded document.View the Live Demo Here(Note: Replace this link with your actual live demo URL after deploying!)Key FeaturesInteractive Q&A: Ask questions in natural language and receive answers directly from your textbook's content.PDF & Text File Support: Upload .pdf or .txt files of any size, processed securely on the server.RAG Architecture: Ensures that all answers are grounded in the provided text, preventing the model from using outside knowledge.Student & Teacher Tools: Includes features to automatically generate chapter-wise study guides and multiple-choice quizzes from the document.Voice-to-Text: Ask questions using your voice for a hands-free experience.Technical StackBackend: Python, FlaskAI Model: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro APIPDF Processing: PyMuPDFFrontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScriptDeployment: Render (or any other WSGI server host)How It WorksThis application follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow:File Upload & Processing: The user uploads a PDF, which is read and parsed into plain text on the Flask server.Text Chunking: The extracted text is broken down into smaller, manageable, overlapping chunks.Context Retrieval: When a user asks a question, the backend performs a simple keyword search to find the most relevant text chunks (the "context").Prompt Engineering: The user's question and the retrieved context are combined into a carefully crafted prompt for the Gemini model.Answer Generation: The Gemini API processes the prompt and generates an answer based only on the context provided.Frontend Display: The answer is sent back to the user's browser and displayed in the chat interface.How to Run LocallyClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/textbook-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/textbook-app.git)
